                <p>The Hitler Youth was a group for young people in Nazi Germany. It started in the 1920s and became a big, official organization in the 1930s. The group gave kids activities and a sense of belonging, but it also taught Nazi beliefs and prepared many members to help during the war.</p>

            <h2>Origins & Timeline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Early 1920s: small local Nazi youth groups formed.</li>
                <li>1926: groups began to come together under the name "Hitler Youth".</li>
                <li>1933: after the Nazis took power, independent youth groups were closed and the HJ grew quickly.</li>
                <li>1936: laws made the organisation more official and standardized.</li>
                <li>March 1939: membership became effectively required for many youths (about ages 10–18).</li>
                <li>1944–1945: older teens were increasingly used in the war, sometimes in fighting roles.</li>
                <li>1945: after Germany's defeat, Allied authorities banned Nazi groups, including the Hitler Youth.</li>

            <h2>Leadership & Organisation</h2>
            <p>Key leaders and how the group was organised:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Baldur von Schirach</strong> — led the Hitler Youth from 1931 to 1940.</li>
                <li><strong>Arthur Axmann</strong> — took over in 1940 and led during most of the war.</li>
                <li>Structure: national leaders at the top, then regional (Gau) leaders, then local units. There were also special branches for aviation and naval training.</li>
                <li>The Hitler Youth answered to the Nazi Party and later worked more with the army for training and wartime tasks.</li>

                <li>Rallies, radio shows, and films made membership look exciting.</li>
                <li>Uniforms, badges, camps, and competitions made kids want to belong.</li>
                <li>Legal rules and the closing of other groups left few options for those who didn't want to join.</li>
