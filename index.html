                <p>The Hitler Youth is a generation of young people who devoted their energy and passion to the Hitler Youth organization, leaving a mark on world history. They were proud to be in the Hitler Youth. Formed in 1926, it offered its members excitement, adventure, and new heroes to worship.</p>

            <blockquote class="hitler-quote">
                <p>"I begin with the young. We older ones are used up… But my magnificent youngsters! Look at these men and boys! What material! With them, I can create a new world."</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Hitler counted on Germany's boys and girls. On January 30, 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany, largely because of the Hitler Youth's efforts.</p>

            <h2>Growth and Membership</h2>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>By 1939, all other youth organizations were banned. The Hitler Youth (boys) and the League of German Girls (girls) became almost mandatory. Over 82% of eligible youth participated. Jewish youths were not allowed to join and set up their own groups in the 1930s.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Membership Growth</h3>
                    <ul class="statistics">
                        <li><strong>End of 1933:</strong> 100,000 members</li>
                        <li><strong>1937:</strong> 5.4 million members</li>
                        <li><strong>1940:</strong> 7.2 million members</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The group grew rapidly due to state encouragement and peer pressure. In March 1939, membership for ages 10-18 became mandatory. Non-compliance could result in legal punishment.</p>

            <p>Hitler Youth served as soldiers, nurses, and secretaries. They prepared care packages to support the war effort.</p>
            <p>Youth in illegal youth groups could be arrested or sent to concentration camps.</p>

            </blockquote>
            
            <p>Hitler Youth was designed to indoctrinate Hitler's ideology into the next generation. After World War II, it took former members years to step back from the indoctrination.</p>
            
            <p>Banning scouting sent the message of obeying or being punished, which also drove more children to join.</p>

            <h2>Resistance</h2>
            <p>Some boys who refused to join created illegal groups. The Edelweiss Pirates, containing around 5,000 members, were one such group. They:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attacked Hitler Youth members</li>
                <li>Worked to sabotage their activities</li>
                <li>Scribbled anti-war graffiti on walls</li>

            <h2>End of the War</h2>
            <p>In 1945, younger boys were pulled to the front lines. These inexperienced children were essentially recruited for suicide missions. Children who refused could be executed.</p>
            <p>After the war, the Hitler Youth was disbanded.</p>
